Tiny C program that formats your latest Nightscout BGL reading for use in
your terminal prompt (a.k.a $PS1). It's written in C to be as fast as possible,
since it gets executed every time the prompt is rendered, so latency is critical.

You will need to set up [`nightscout-ps1-daemon`][daemon] which is responsible for
connecting to your Nightscout server and creating the INI file that this
program reads.

The trend and target high/low values are also provided, so that you may
render arrows and colors as desired:

### Installation

Preferred installation is by downloading a pre-compiled binary for your platform:

* [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TooTallNate/nightscout-ps1/releases)

If there is no binary for your platform, or you would simply like to install
from source, invoke the `make` command:

```bash
# build the `nightscout-ps1` binary
$ git submodule update --init
$ make
$ ./out/Default/nightscout-ps1

# install to /usr/local by default, set PREFIX for a custom dir
$ make install
```

### Configure your `$PS1`

Add this to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PS1="\$(nightscout-ps1) $ "
```

Be sure to add further customizations to your `$PS1` from there!

### Windows

Looking for the Windows version that was mentioned on [Scott Hanselman's blog](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualizingYourRealtimeBloodSugarValuesANDAGitPromptOnWindowsPowerShellAndLinuxBash.aspx)? For now use [version 1.1.4](https://github.com/TooTallNate/nightscout-ps1/tree/1.1.4) here and those instructions will work.
